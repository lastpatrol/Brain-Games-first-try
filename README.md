# Brain Games
This is a set of simple command-line games written in JavaScript. The architecture of the program consists of separate modules: the core (index.js file), which implements the user interaction logic, and several games (js files in games folder), which launch and provide data to the core. Such modular layout makes it easy to add new games to the set. No need to rewrite the main logic all over again. 


## Installation
Execute from the terminal:  
    `npm install -g brain-games-hexlet-tim`
